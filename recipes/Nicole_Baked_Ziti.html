    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package ziti pasta</li>
        <li>¾ pound ground Italian sausage</li>
        <li>¾ pound ground sirloin</li>
        <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon ground pepper, divided</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>2 (24 ounce) jars marinara sauce</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) container whole milk ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>1 ½ (8 ounce) packages mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add 1 tablespoon kosher salt to the boiling water and stir in pasta. Cook until just about tender to the bite, about 8 minutes (or 1 to 2 minutes less than package instructions).</li>
        <li>At the same time, heat a large, deep skillet or saucepan over medium-high heat. Add sausage and beef and cook, crumbling with the back of a spoon, until browned, about 5 minutes. Add onion, garlic, 3/4 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and pepper flakes; cook until onion is translucent and softened, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain pasta and return to the pot. Add about 1/2 cup marinara; toss to coat and let sit until needed.</li>
        <li>Add remaining marinara sauce to the browned meat mixture. Pour 1/4 cup water into each jar, shake to release any leftover sauce in the jar, and pour into the skillet. Stir and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir ricotta cheese, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, egg, parsley, basil, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Add 2 cups meat sauce to the pasta; toss to coat.</li>
        <li>Spread 1/2 cup meat sauce into the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Add ½ of the pasta mixture and top with 2 cups meat sauce. Lightly dollop and spread ricotta mixture over the top and sprinkle evenly with 1 1/2 cups mozzarella cheese. Add remaining pasta mixture, remaining meat sauce, and remaining mozzarella on top. Sprinkle evenly with remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden and bubbly, 25 to 30 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
